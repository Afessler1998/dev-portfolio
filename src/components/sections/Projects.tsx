              description="Level Up Exercise Log, my first significant coding project, 
              initiated in 2020, transforms fitness logging into a rewarding, gamified 
              experience. Utilizing React Native and Node.js, it integrates OAuth for 
              secure login and includes a custom SVG graph for progress tracking, 
              demonstrating an early proficiency at implementing novel and innovative solutions." />
              <ProjectCard image={PaintingImg} title="Fesslerpainting.com" 
              description="Fesslerpainting.com, developed for my own residential 
              painting business. Built using Next.js, the website features a 
              minimalist, responsive design and server-side rendering, showcasing 
              my proficiency in modern web development. This venture, while 
              successful, ultimately led me to follow my true passion for programming." />
              <ProjectCard image={CircuitImg} title="Turing Complete CPU" 
              description="In 'Turing Complete,' a game that turns CPU design into an 
              interactive learning experience, I constructed a CPU architecture from 
              the ground up, designing circuits and logic gates. While including 
              a video game project might appear unconventional in a professional portfolio, 
              it profoundly enriched my understanding of CPU architecture and the nuances 
              of low-level programming." />
              <ProjectCard image={TypewriterImg} title="Interactive Story Writer" 
              description="Interactive Story Writer, a Python script I developed to 
              solve a core problem in a group project for a class of mine: crafting 
              a detailed, branching narrative for a text-based adventure game. Leveraging 
              the OpenAI API, using an innovative algorithm I devised, the script
              generates a rich, coherent narrative. The result? Our project had an impressive
              2186 unique endings." />
              <ProjectCard image={BedframeImg} title="Floating Bedframe" 
              description="A floating bed frame. Yes, you read that rightâ€”a bed frame in my 
              developer portfolio. This project is entirely of my own design. Detailed math 
              was applied to perfect the floating illusion and to engineer a circuit capable 
              of handling the LED's demands. While it may seem out of place, this bed frame 
              embodies my versatile problem-solving abilities, merging engineering 
              principles and programming skills beyond the digital realm." />
              <ProjectCard image={AsciiImg} title="ASCII Art Generator" 
              description="ASCII Art Generator, a Python script I developed, creatively applies 
              convolution to translate images into colored ASCII art. By averaging color values 
              and brightness, it maps images onto a grid of ASCII characters, each carefully 
              chosen for its visual weight and color. Showcasing my technical prowess with algorithm
              design and my fascination with the intersection of mathematics and logic with art and creativity." />
