Leveraging the OpenAI API, and using an innovative algorithm I devised, the script generates a rich, coherent narrative. The result? Our project had an impressive 2186 unique endings."

While it may seem out of place, this bed frame embodies my versatile problem-solving abilities, merging engineering principles and programming skills beyond the digital realm. This project is entirely of my own design. Detailed math was applied to perfect the floating illusion and to engineer a circuit capable of handling the LED's demands."
